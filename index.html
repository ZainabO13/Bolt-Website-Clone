       powers the fastest buying experience, end-to-end, 
        including one-click checkout.
   Bolt enables shoppers to securely save their information 
during their first purchase within the Bolt Network.
 Once saved, a shopper never has to enter personal or
  payment information again. When a shopper returns to 
  any merchant in our network, they can checkout without 
  completing any forms or remembering any passwords, even
   if they have never purchased from that merchant before. 
   Instead, a One-Time-Password (OTP) is sent to their phone
    or email to proceed with a secure one click checkout.

                    No. Bolt is not an additional APM or a checkout plugin. 
                    Bolt replaces your checkout with a lightweight modal to 
                    ensure the customer experience is seamless. Unlike plugins 
                    that redirect your customers away from your store to register
                     and potentially abandon their cart, Bolt appears seamless to
                      your shoppers and they never leave your site.

                    With each additional field in the checkout process, 
                    shoppers have a higher chance of dropping off and
                     not completing their purchase. With Bolt, 
                     the checkout form has 8 fewer fields on average,
                      significantly decreasing the time to purchase 
                      and reducing the possibility of user error. 
                      Bolt's integrated fraud detection means shoppers 
                      don't need to input their billing address. Shoppers
                       making a purchase at any Bolt merchant for the first 
                       time can complete their purchase as a guest and then 
                       create a Bolt Account at the end, while returning Bolt Account shoppers 
                    can complete their purchases with a single click..

      of shoppers in a unified, cross-brand network.

shoppers with Bolt accounts like returning customers by offering 
them one-click checkout, regardless of whether or not the shopper 
has purchased from that retailer before.

                <h2>Does Bolt offer a virtual terminal?</h2>
            <button class="btn-d"> <i class="ri-arrow-down-circle-fill"></i></button>    
               <button  style="display: none;" class="btn-u">  <i  class="ri-arrow-up-circle-fill"></i> </button>
                <p class="info" id="info" >
                   Yes. Bolt's Virtual Terminal is a transaction portal that allows online retailers to charge a credit card on behalf of a customer. Similar to a point-of-sale (POS) terminal, Bolt's Virtual Terminal requires a full set of customer information: first name, last name, card number, expiration date, card verification value number (CVV) email address, and phone number.

Important considerations when using the Virtual Terminal include:

Virtual Terminal transactions do not sync with your e-commerce platform.
Payment is captured at the time of a successful authorization, also called autocapture.
Payments are auto-approved after successful authorization as they don't undergo any risk review.
